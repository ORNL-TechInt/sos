Important Things
----------------
Usefullness :: The goal of this work is to design a useful meaningful systems
for HPC and Big Data applications.  To that end,
all design decisions need to be evaluated with:  Is there a use case?

Scalability :: Storage systems incorporating thousands of disks are one key
element in storing large quantities of data.  Further, leveraging thousands of
clients simultaneously is also critical to enabling high-performance data
ingest and analysis.  All design decisions need to be evaluated with:  Will it
scale?

Performance :: Put simply performance matters.  Existing systems provide the
storage reliability and capacity required for HPC and Big Data Apps.  The only
remaining hurdle is performance.  Performance considerations include namespace
performance, I/O performance, and management performance.  All design
decisions need to be evaluated with:  Will it perform well?

Locality :: One key idea in our earlier discussions was that storage locality
matters.  It was one of the critical ideas in enhancing existing storage
system capabilities.  Locality affects performance and scalability, and brings
with it interesting namespace and data lifetime and accessibility issues.
Locality was also one of the key ideas in our replication and QOS schemes.
All design decisions need to be evaluated with:  How does this enable users to
access their data with greater locality?

Consistency :: Data consistency in essence assures the user that they interact
with a view of the storage system that doesn't surprise them.  Unfortunately,
the easiest models are often the slowesta and least scalable.  All design
decisions need to be evaluated with:  Will a user be able to interact with the
data in the storage system effectively?

Unimportant Things
------------------
Note: These topics are up for debate.  If it is important, that's fine.  Bring
a reason it is important, and add it to the above section.

File Formats :: We have discussed log-formatted data, and while this is
interesting to me personally, it is probably not a critical issue during the
early phases of the design process.

Specific Media Characteristics :: In general, I don't think the underlying
media characteristics should be a primary factor in our design.

Other Identified Design Questions
---------------------------------

What is the maximum size of an object?  Why does it matter?

What is the consistency model?

What does the client interface look like?

When does replication occur?

How does replication occur?

How are QOS notifications distributed?
