Nuclear Physics Use-Case: Single Nuclei Simulation  
==============

Description
-----------

One of the two primary simulation types in nuclear physics is single nuclei
simulation.


Actors
------

- MFDN
- file system

Assumptions
-----------

MFDn (app name)
Many Fermion Dynamics-nuclear


Steps
-----------

- prepare single, shared input file, ~ tens of Gigabytes

- specify convergency time, ~ 4 - 12 hours

- specify checkpoint: every tens or hundreds of iterations. The size of
  checkpoint file grows with the number of iterations.

- runs on full size of the machine

- a group of I/O processes generate a single output file: ~ tens of Tera bytes 

- post-processing is minimal (different from ensemble run) - it may be boils
  down to a single number.

Variations
----------

This may qualify as a separate use-case.

Lots of small processes (10,000), each simulate a type of nuclei (3000, known,
6000 unknown), Very small input file, broadcast to everyone.  each process
generates a small output file. 


Issues
