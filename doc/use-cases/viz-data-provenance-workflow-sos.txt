Description
-----------
A typical problem that occurs in visualization science is that a scientist
unaffiliated with the initial visualization sees something of interest in the
image.  The scientist contacts the team that generated the image and asks
where the image came from.  At present, this problem is unresolved.  This use
case describes how it could conceivably be serviced if the storage system
support existed.

Actors
------
Sam, a Nuclear Computational Scientist
Victor, a Viz Expert
Derek, a Nuclear Domain Expert
SOS, an Object Storage System
VisiT, a visualization toolkit
Lens, a Viz cluster
Nuke'em, a Nuclear Science code
Jaguar, a complute resource


Assumptions
-----------
A Nuke'em movie from an earlier run exists.  Further all of the data
associated with the movie still exists within the storage system.

Steps
-----
1. Derek sees an old Nuke'Em image from a framecap and is interested to see a
  different angle than that presented in the movie (to examine a new phenomenon
  he is interested in).
2. Derek contacts Samand Victor to request more info about the movie.
3. Victor is able to use provenance data in the frame cap to identify the
   movie that the interesting frame came from.
4. Victor then is able to mine the provenance data associated with the the
   movie to to identify and locate:
  a) the reduced data set used to construct the movie,
  b) the visualization toolkit version and all the relevant information about
     Lens, the visulization compute platform,
  c) the raw data set set used during exploratory analysis, and
  d) he Nuke'em version and all the relevant information about jaguar, the
  compute resource used to generate the original simulation data
5. Victor and Sam are able to use the collected provenance data to locate the
  original data and build a new movie that includes a detailed shot of the
  region of interest for Derek.
6.  Derek, Victor, and Sam submit a new journal paper based on this phenomena
  that results in popular media interest in Nuclear science and makes
  millionaires of all three.

Variations
----------
1.  What provenance data to collect is still up in the air, but basically, collect
everything.
2.  The originating image may be a movie or just a screencap.
